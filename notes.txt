frontend- deploying on firebase 
backend - deploying on heroku

For fronend -we are using firebase for hosting, authentication
For real time functionality of chat application, we will be using mongoDb's change stream and pusher, when there is a chnage in mongodb's selected collection that will fire off the chnage stream and that will fire off pusher which will fire off the axios/fetch function on the frontend which will refresh all the conversation and so you will see everything in real time

Pusher : With firebase we will be using a real time database, means if something is added or deleted, the application is gonna triggered. With mongodb this does not work, for mongodb you have to trigger refresh for mongodb for real time so it does not work for mongodb, to make mongodb real time we are using pusher, also we are using change stream with mongodb, we are going to set the change stream to our mongodb collection, whenever there is change in the collection change stream is going to trigger the pusher it is going to upload to the pusher, pusher will be connected to the frontend and then the new change will be pushed by pusher to frontend
